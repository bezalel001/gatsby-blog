Modern day control engineering is a relatively new field of study that gained significant attention during the 20th century with the advancement of technology. It can be broadly defined or classified as practical application of[control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory "Control theory"). Control engineering plays an essential role in a wide range of control systems, from simple household washing machines to high-performance[F-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-16 "F-16")fighter aircraft. It seeks to understand physical systems, using mathematical modelling, in terms of inputs, outputs and various components with different behaviors; to use control system design tools to develop[controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controller_(control_theory) "Controller (control theory)")for those systems; and to implement controllers in physical systems employing available technology. A[system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system "Control system")can be[mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "Mechanical engineering"),[electrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering"),[fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid "Fluid"),[chemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical "Chemical"),[financial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance "Finance")or[biological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"), and its mathematical modelling, analysis and controller design uses[control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory "Control theory")in one or many of the[time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_domain "Time domain"),[frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain "Frequency domain")and[complex-s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_domain "S domain")domains, depending on the nature of the design problem.
