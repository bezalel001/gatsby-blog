**Systems engineering** is an[ interdisciplinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinary "Interdisciplinary") field of [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering") and [engineering  management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_management "Engineering management") that focuses on how to design and manage [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system "Complex system") over their [life cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_life_cycle "Enterprise life cycle"). At its core, systems engineering utilizes [systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking "Systems thinking") principles to organize this body of knowledge. The individual outcome of such efforts, an **engineered system**, can be defined as a combination of components that work in [synergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy "Synergy") to collectively perform a useful [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(engineering) "Function (engineering)").

Issues such as[ requirements engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_engineering "Requirements engineering"), reliability, [logistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics "Logistics"), coordination of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability and many other [disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_(academia) "Discipline (academia)") necessary for successful system design, development, implementation, and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work-processes, optimization methods, and [risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management "Risk management") tools in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as [industrial engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_engineering "Industrial engineering"), [process systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_systems_engineering "Process systems engineering"), [mechanical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "Mechanical engineering"), [manufacturing engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_engineering "Manufacturing engineering"), [control engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_engineering "Control engineering"), [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering "Software engineering"), [electrical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering"), [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics "Cybernetics"), [organizational studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_studies "Organizational studies"), [civil engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineering "Civil engineering") and [project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management "Project management"). Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered, and integrated into a whole.

The systems engineering process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a manufacturing process. A manufacturing process is focused on repetitive activities that achieve high quality outputs with minimum cost and time. The systems engineering process must begin by discovering the real problems that need to be resolved, and identifying the most probable or highest impact failures that can occur â€“ systems engineering involves finding solutions to these problems.
