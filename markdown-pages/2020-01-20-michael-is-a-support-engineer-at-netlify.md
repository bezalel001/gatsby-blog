**About yourself**



I would describe myself as a person with a versatile skill set. This is because I haveinterests that spread across multiple fields including technology,business, teaching, languages and leadership.



I startedmy career in management and IT consulting ,where my focus was on helping businesses to uncover the right tech product and services for their business problems. I helped our clients to access software products and services to help them seize opportunities to work faster, smarter and with more agility. I also provided training on how to use the technology and provided both on-site and remote support to enable them to fully use the tech products and services.



During this time,I learnt how to convey technical information in a way people could relate to. This was because the clients were number one focus in my role and it was important that the information I provided to them was not only accurate but understood by the them.



I also discovered my passion for connecting people and businesses to technology. Igenuinely enjoyedteaching them everyday to enable them to make full use of software products and services.



I learnt that A deep understanding of customers needs, preferences and past interaction is absolutely important if as a company you want to unleash new levels of connectivity,engagement and relevance with your customers.







In addition to my IT consulting and IT support experience, I also have a strong software development experience in Javascript and Python.



In one of my engagements with a company seeking to grow by looking into continuous customers relevance.

I used my technical skills,to extract , process and analyse their customers data.The result of the analysis showed that only 22% of their consumers say that the company actually tailor their experiences based on a deep understanding of customer needs, preferences and past interaction. Despite the fact the management of the company knows that products, services and experience should be more meaningful to the customers.



To improve continuous customers relevance for this particular client, I selected the right mix of technologies, trained them and provided technical support on the technologies to help them optimise processes and operations and unleash new levels of connectivity,engagement and relevance with their customers.



My experiences in providing IT support has thought me how to convey technical information in a way people can relate to, empathy and deep investigation and debugging skills.





Right now, I am looking for an opportunity that will integrate my passion forproblem-solving, technology, business, teaching and leadership. Indeed technical support role is exactly what I am looking for.
